ZotClass Mobile

This was the first hackathon I've mentored for! I was a mentor for ZotHacks 2022 and I mentored a group of 4 beginners who've never done a hackathon before and had minimal project experience. It was incredibly rewarding and I'm super impressed with the progress they made in only 12 hours!

I helped them with ideation, selecting a tech stack, and taught them the basics of planning and seeing a project through. However, the most valuable skill I think I taught them was that it's not about what you know, but whether you can find it out by yourself.

The team was rewarded by their efforts with a first place prize in the entire hackathon!
