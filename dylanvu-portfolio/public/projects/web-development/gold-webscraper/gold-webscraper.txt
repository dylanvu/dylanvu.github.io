GOLD (Gaucho On-Line Data) Web Scraper

/projects/web-development/gold-webscraper/gold-webscraper.png

This was my first ever Python project, and the project that inspired me to cultivate my current interest in coding. Developed initially for UCSB’s American Institute of Chemical Engineers chapter, GOLDWebscraper obtains the current course spaces and other associated information from UCSB GOLD (Gaucho OnLine Data). The script uses Selenium to navigate through the site and BeautifulSoup4 to parse through the HTML.

I used this project to teach myself the basics of Python— using pip to install libraries, exploring library documentation, learning the very introductory basics of object-oriented programming, such as creating classes and instantiating them.

I admit, it can be improved a lot, but it was a very rewarding first project!
