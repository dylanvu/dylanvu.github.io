UCSB AIChE Lab Reservation/Registration

/projects/ts-js/lab-reservation/lab-reservation.png

At the request of the UCSB AIChE Project Lead, I developed a reservation system with the help of AIChE's website manager to enable UCSB AIChE members to reserve lab spaces to work on their projects. In this project, I focused a lot on error catching and input validation, and sending correct status codes. I also slightly dipped my toes in Next.js here by deploying a serverless function to make reservations and taught the website manager React!

While she worked on most of the frontend, I created the serverless backend.
