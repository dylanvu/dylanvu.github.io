F•sync

/projectgroup/javascript/fsync/fsync.png

This was my team's submission to HackHarvard 2021. F•sync is an inventory management app to enable brands to view their inventory across any retailer as well as enable other retailers to view the stock of any other retailer.

This was by far the largest project I've ever worked on and it's amazing how it was accomplished during a hackathon! I learnt a lot about planning ahead, designing a database schema in MongoDB, and definitely got better at working with MongoDB and integrating sockets using createContext on the frontend. I also tried out a bit of Chakra UI and using the Twilio API.

F•sync won "Most Creative Use of Twilio" at HackHarvard!
