Geoverse

This was my submission to Cal Hacks 2021. Geoverse is a text-adventure and fitness mobile game where users are encouraged to run to progress through an AI-generated story. My role here was to develop the frontend myself using Flutter.

It was a bit nervewracking developing an entire project using a platform and language I hadn't worked with before, but I'm quite pleased with the amount of work I was able to do in such a short amount of time. Knowing React definitely helped me grasp the basics of Flutter's widget system relatively quickly.

I also learnt a lot of key agile development (Spiral development) and best Git practices from my team's project manager!
