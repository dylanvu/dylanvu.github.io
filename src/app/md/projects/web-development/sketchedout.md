# SketchedOut

![Picture of SketchedOut website interface](/projects/web-development/sketchedout/sketchedout.png)

This was my second ever hackathon project, a collaborative whiteboard web app, submitted to SacHacks. Here, I learnt about the backend, implementing an Express NodeJS webserver and used Socket.io websockets to connect clients to each other and receive whiteboard data. I also programmed and learnt more about React hooks, such as useRef and useEffect
