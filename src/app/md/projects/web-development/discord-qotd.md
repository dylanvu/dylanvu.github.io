# Discord Questions of the Day Bot

A prominent feature of the American Institute of Chemical Engineer's (AIChE) Discord server during the COVID-19 pandemic was our "Question of the Day" (QOTD) bot that we found online. However, mid-way during the pandemic, the bot suddenly stopped working properly. Rather than let this aspect of AIChE vanish, I instead wrote my own QOTD bot to fill the void, helping continue engage our members and let them learn more about each other.

This bot is also part of the UCSB Robotics club and Solo Development, a Discord server with 1500+ members.
