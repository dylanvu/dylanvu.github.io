# BlockStalk

This was my team's submission to LA Hacks 2023. BlockStalk is a device that works in tandem with software meant to warn you if someone is following you using human recognition. Built using Mediapipe API, a Raspberry Pi, and the Raspberry Pi NoIR camera, this project had so many challenges, especially in hardware.

I ended up ordering many, many components incorrectly, and I had to plan ahead the best I could. And even despite all my planning, we still lacked a few materials that would have helped us out. This is the hackathon where I realized the immense difficulty of pulling off a completely successful hardware hack.

For example, we needed resistors to lower the voltage in order to power the Raspberry Pi using the LiPo battery we bought. Also, we realized that we needed transistors to switch on and off the Flash LED.
