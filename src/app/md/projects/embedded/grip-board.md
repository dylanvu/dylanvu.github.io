# GRIP Board - Grasp Responsive Interactive Projector Board

GRIP Board was my team's submission to Pinnacle, the "Olympics" of hackathons where the winners of the top 50 collegiate hackathons across North America are invited to compete against each other.

I learnt a lot about computer vision, specifically camera calibration. It was also my first Python project in a while, so it was fun to hop back into the language again! I was also the only software person in the team, so I developed most of the aspects of the software, including integration of the CV portion and the actual drawing portion.

Later, once Pinnacle was over, I implemented basic websockets via Socket.io to broadcast the board information as a proof of concept for a hybrid learning situation.

It was really cool to see how accurate our drawing ended up being!
