Caption

/projects/embedded/caption/caption.png

Caption, submitted to HackUCI 2023, is a device meant to generate subtitles in real time and display them on glasses. BCaption was built using ESP32 CAM, MAX 9814 microphone and amplifier, an OLED Display, and an FTDI programmer.

It was my first hardware project that I helped plan from scratch, playing a role in designing the schematic. I also programmed an ESP32 for the first time to connect to WiFi! I felt a bit out of my comfort zone, as I was freshly out of the Open Project Space electrical engineering/circuitry portion of the program, yet I was tackling a hardware hackathon with what I had learned only weeks ago.

I served as the one to double check wiring with the schematics and also made the call to do many pivots for hardware during the hackathon. I also, most importantly, learned that not all microcontrollers are made the same and that extensive research before selecting one for a project is immensely important. I found out that I needed to research my options just as carefully as I research future frameworks and libraries I want to pick up.
