# WordShip

Introducing my seventh hackathon submission, this time for SB Hacks VIII, WordShip! Wordship is one of the most interesting projects I've worked on, combining two extremely different genres: the 2022 hit game "Wordle" and a retro arcade "Mainic Shooter" style game. In addition to having a really cool combination of games, this is one of my most polished hackathon projects I've worked on. As a result, my team and I got an honorable mention during the awards ceremony due to the polish, creativity, and execution of this game!

I worked on the overall software architecture, defining the tech stacks and tasks while acting as a project manager. I also wrote the Wordle-clone algorithm, figured out WebSockets in Godot, wrote the socket events, and helped with a few Godot game mechanics such as the lunging and the Wordle HUD.
