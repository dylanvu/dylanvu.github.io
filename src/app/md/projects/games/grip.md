# GRIP - Grasp Responsive Inflatable Pouch Controller

![Picture of GRIP](/projects/games/grip/grip.png)

This was my third hackathon submission. GRIP is a tactile-responsive VR controlled my team and I created for LA Hacks. Prior to this, I had never touched C# or Unity before, so it was fairly challenging to learn how to use Unity well enough to create an interactive scene to show off the capability of the VR controller. My role was to program the object and controller mechanics, utilizing the physics engine and scripts to translate objects and the player controller hand around and enable controller-object interactions.
