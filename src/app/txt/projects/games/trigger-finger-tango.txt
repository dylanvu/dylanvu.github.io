Trigger Finger Tango

My team's entry to QWER Hacks 2024! This is a gesture-based shooting game where you make "finger guns" to fire a gun. This was my first time working in Unreal Engine, and working with WebSockets in Unreal Engine. While I did a similar integration with Godot (see: WordShip), Unreal proved to be a bigger challenge since my teammate responsible for implemeting the assets, physics, and destructible environment, Casey, worked mainly in the Blueprint. So, I ended up breaking the game several times while integrating.

Overall, a cool experience! My talented teammates, Bryant and Thao, did an amazing job custom-training the gestures for Mediapipe and sending the data over to Trigger Finger Tango as well.
