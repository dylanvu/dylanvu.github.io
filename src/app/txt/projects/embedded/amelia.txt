Despite the... "interesting" appearance...

Amelia is actually one of the most interesting projects I've ever worked on.

The part I'm most proud of is the integration with Google Gemini enabling Amelia to actually "think" for herself and perform actions autonomously to complete your requests. Prompt engineering was done to effectively give her autonomy.

In a nutshell, we gave a Generative AI LLM (Google Gemini) physical form: the ability to see, move, talk, and hear. I feel like the concept of using an LLM to solve a request, and put it into a series of actionable steps is a super interesting idea.
