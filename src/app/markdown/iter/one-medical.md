# One Medical

At One Medical, I was part of the Engineering Experience team. My main project was to speed up unit tests and I achieved a **21% reduction** in total unit test runtime, saving **~$222k/year or 3086 engineering** hours by reducing Ruby Rspec FactoryBot calls, sharing objects during tests, and optimizing test object creation.

I then presented to a diverse audience of over **100 people**, including interns, senior engineers, and executives to convey internship project details and impact, demonstrating communication and public speaking skills.
