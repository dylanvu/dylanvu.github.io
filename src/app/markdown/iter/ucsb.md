# University of California, Santa Barbara

## Freshman Year

I entered UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2019 in the Freshman Summer Start Program originally as a mechanical engineering student aiming to go into astronautical engineering with dreams of working for NASA.

Later on, I realized that I honestly enjoyed my chemistry class way too much and decided to go into chemical engineering instead, looking to follow my second path: get involved in the medical industry in some capacity. I initially juggled goals of going into pharmaceuticals, biomaterials, and even pre-med for a bit.

## Sophomore Year

It was in my second year at UCSB that I decided to pick up Python since I heard it was a good skill to have in chemical engineering. I then taught myself Python by making a webscraper to help chart how quick classes at UCSB filled up, and I absolutely loved every second of learning and building that project. Instead of study for my organic chemistry final, I was instead diving deep into Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, and OpenPyxl.

After seeing me get so excited about programming, my friends in computer science invited me to learn React with them, do my first hackathon, and join other programming related clubs. I then started taking programming classes to "fake minor" (UCSB did not have a computer science minor) or even potentially get a masters degree in the field.

Before I knew it, I was basically a computer science student! I initially resolved to complete my chemical engineering degree and figure out if I wanted to go into software engineering or do something more programming heavy in chemical engineering until I had to take a gap year due to family issues.
