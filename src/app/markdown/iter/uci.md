# University of California, Irvine

## Junior Year

At UC Irivine, I was part of the Information and Computer Science Student Council (ICSSC) as a member of the events committee, leading technical workshops and running fun events.

I also participated in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Open Project Space (OPS), learning how to do electrical engineering and firmware with an Arduino Nano.

Notable/fun classes I took:

* Game Design Fundamentals
* Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
* Computer Networks
* Embedded Systems
* Operating Systems

I then interned at [One Medical](/star/one-medical) for the summer.

## Senior Year

I returned to the events committee again as a member and to IEEE OPS as an instructor. I also had a huge hackathon spree again, the final hurrah before I graduated.

Notable classes I took:

* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Programming Languages I (I LOVED this class)
* Vietnamese 1A and 1B
* Databases
* User Interaction Software
* Advanced Computer Networks 
* Distributed Systems
* CS Project, where I built a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) LLM trivia game for Paciolan
* EECS Senior Design Project (for no credit, since I was not in EECS. I took it to build an interdisciplinary project with Electrical and Computer Engineers) building a Flutter application paired with a wellness sensor for Thales Avionics
* Graduate robotic autonomy, where I learned Robotic Operation System and Gazebo

After graduating, I headed off to One Medical (now acquired by [Amazon](/star/amazon))for my first job out of college!
