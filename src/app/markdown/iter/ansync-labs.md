# Ansync Labs

Ansync Labs was my first internship and sort of first full-time gig as a Junior Software Engineer for the time before I transferred to UC Irvine.

## Software Developer Intern

I helped develop an internal package receiving and parts inventory software for Ansync hosted on Firebase/Google Cloud for the spring semester. I also pioneered a TypeScript (TS) testing framework npm package for internal use for all future TS projects in an attempt to move the company to a more test-driven development process.

I configured GitLab CI/CD pipelines for testing and automated semantic releases for packages and also provided support to the web development team by developing components for the company website and writing user authentication cloud functions.

## Junior Software Developer

Once I was promoted to a full-time employee with the same responsibilities and expectations of one:

I spearheaded an effort to fully test Ansync IoT devices, focusing on firmware automation testing and end-to-end integration tests. I designed and implemented a TypeScript microservice to automate ESP32 firmware load testing, which prevented potential failure of an entire IoT product line by identifying 8 critical OTA firmware bugs. After that success, I worked on a preliminary software architecture design for a fully automated device farm integrated with our IoT testing framework to run end-to-end integration tests with Flutter Apps and our IoT devices across various Android and iOS versions.

I refactored the firmware automation testing framework in accordance with SOLID Object Oriented Programming principles, presenting designs focused on easily extendable classes to the Software Team Manager and other senior developers to help shape the direction of our IoT device testing strategy.

When a critical issue threatened production timelines, I ended a week-long production halt in an internal QA workflow for a high-profile client's $1M+ preventative health device project by independently diagnosing and repairing Bash and Node.js scripts. I improved our CI/CD firmware workflow by automatically triggering device integration tests on specific test units on the "testing rack" to catch future firmware bugs.

Beyond testing infrastructure, I implemented functionality in Ansync Lab's website, converting the HTML and CSS our web designer creates into reusable components as vanilla web components. I also resolved any Git mishaps that may occur on our website repository and guided new interns by delegating tasks, mentoring them, and helping them debug their issues while escalating and presenting difficult issues to more senior developers.
