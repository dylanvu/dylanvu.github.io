This "night sky" is Dylan's portfolio website and he crafted it as a metaphor representing himself. Every star is a part of him and each constellation is a cluster of related parts.

The constellations serve as a meaningful way to organize the atomic aspects of Dylan's portfolio

Why is Dylan represented by a night sky? He loves star gazing and looking at the night sky. He also loves metaphors.

Fun fact: about 70% of the initial version of this night sky was programmed in a single rainy weekend of November, 2025 while Dylan was sick with a cold. This night sky was programmed with React-Konva, Motion, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and lots of fun and joy. And some help from ChatGPT, but the second day was relatively ChatGPT-free.

The current constellations in this night sky are:

- Viae: "roads"
- Iter: "journey, path"
- Arete: "excellence, skill"
- Elevare: "to elevate"

For example, the "Viae" constellation is a cluster of stars that lead to Dylan's works outside of this night sky. Viae is arranged as a network of roads, since this constellation is the sort of gateway to external "worlds" (websites) outside of "this night sky" (Dylan's portfolio).

Iter Major represents Dylan's career, and Iter minor is his educational journey. Iter is latin for "journey, path". Iter here is depicted as a jagged path, since his journey was not always smooth.

Arete, Greek representing "excellence, skill", is the constellation representing Dylan's projects. Each star in Arete represents a different project. Arete forms a Laurel, a Greek crown that represents achievement and excellence. Dylan's projects always challenge his skills and push him to grow.

Elevare is the constellation that shows Dylan's hackathons that he's competed in and mentored. It is in the shape of the United States since that's where all of his hackathons took place. The reason why Elevare becomes an actual map component is because... Dylan did not want to program an entire map component. He chose "Elevare" because hackathons are where he learned a lot (elevating himself) and also mentors (elevating others) students. He plotted Elevare by getting a black and white map of the United States, running it through an edge detection algorithm in Python, reducing the number of stars using a Ramer–Douglas–Peucker, and then putting the star coordinates into a file.

Every star is also labeled with a star lifecycle classification. In this metaphor, each classification means something a little different depending on the constellation the star is a part of. Supergiants are the largest stars, representing highly important aspects and are meant to stick out to the eye. Think of them as "must see" stars. Giants are important/impactful. If a giant or supergiant is part of Arete, the projects constellation, it means that the project stood out to Dylan. It usually is because it was technologically challenging, super unique, or very memorable in some way to him.

Stars are neutrally interesting, and Dwarfs are not as important.

The colors themselves don't mean much in this metaphor.

Polaris, known as the "North Star", is a star often used to navigate. In his previous version of his portfolio, Dylan had a chatbot to help others navigate his website and they could ask questions about him. Migrating to this night sky version, he turned the chatbot into something much more thematically appropriate: Polaris, a guiding star!
