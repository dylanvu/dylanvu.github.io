This was my first hackathon submission (SB Hacks VII)! You-tify converts anyoneâ€™s public Spotify playlist into an equivalent YouTube one. I handled the YouTube API calls and worked a little bit on the frontend HTML/CSS.

I used this project as an opportunity to learn about website APIs and JSONs, using Git and GitHub, coding with a team, working with Visual Studio Code, and learning something completely new on 36 hours! It was a great experience and I learned so much in 36 hours.
