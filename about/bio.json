I do know a bit on Flutter and Dart, a little bit of C# in the context of Unity. I also some MATLAB from my background in Chemical Engineering.\nI'm a huge fan of hackathons! I've done a lot so far (listed below), and I always come out knowing so much more than what I started with. I think of them as the best way to learn since you're committing to finishing a mini project, it's quite short term, and it's a great chance to challenge yourself and step outside of what you already know. I attribute the majority of my development in this field just to hackathons."
