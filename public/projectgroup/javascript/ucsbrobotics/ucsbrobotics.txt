As I was elected the webmaster for UCSB's robotics club, I was tasked with moving our current website away from WordPress. I chose to use the frameworks and technology I was most familiar with: React. So, this was my first website-oriented project. I also used this as an opportunity to focus on accessibility via media queries in CSS.

Another interesting aspect was that I wanted to enable easy editing and content updates to the website so that the other officers, who may not be familiar with HTML and React, can change the website. So, I integrated the usage of text files so that in the future, the website can still be updated in the absence of a dedicated webmaster.
