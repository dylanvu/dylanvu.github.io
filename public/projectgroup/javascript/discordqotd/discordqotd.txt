A prominent feature of the American Institute of Chemical Engineer's (AIChE) Discord server during the COVID-19 pandemic was our "Question of the Day" (QOTD) bot that we found online. However, mid-way during the pandemic, the bot suddenly stopped working properly. Rather than let this aspect of AIChE vanish, I instead wrote my own QOTD bot to fill the void, helping continue engage our members and let them learn more about each other.
