My first ever project in Electron.js! I was looking forward to putting what I know in web development (React.js) into a desktop application. While playing a game that I recently got into with my friends, I handicapped myself by making my actions in "Super Auto Pets" be decided entirely by an RNG.

It was a pain to swap back and forth between the game and Google RNG and to explain the rules to my other friends, so I decided this was the perfect opportunity to learn ElectronJS. I definitely learnt a lot about simply distributing and interacting with ElectronJS, but overall it doesn't feel too different from standard web development!

The app itself is quite simplistic, small, and lightweight, but it does add a new element to this game. Plus, I used this as a chance to implement an entire mini project using Chakra UI.

I hope to develop more apps using ElectronJS after this!
