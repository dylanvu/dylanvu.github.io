I'm a student from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

I mostly program using NodeJS, but I'm also familiar with Python and C++. I do know a little bit of C# in the context of Unity, a little bit on the basics of Flutter and Dart, and I also know MATLAB from my background in Chemical Engineering.
