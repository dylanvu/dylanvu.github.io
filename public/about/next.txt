What I'm planning on doing next:

* Make a larger project in Next.js (potentially port my website to Next.js, or a cooking website to store my recipes)

* Make a more complex project in ElectronJS

* Figure out more complex state management in React using contexts and reducers

* Learn Arduino or ESP-32 and pursue a hardware-oriented project

* Learn how to mod a game for the first time
