UCSB AIChE Careers Bot

/projects/web-development/aiche-careers/aiche-careers.png

This was actually my first project in TypeScript and my second-ever Discord Bot! I had been wanting to learn TypeScript, since I consider JavaScript my main language and the static typing of TypeScript would be handy to pick up.

A goal for the UCSB AIChE Student Chapter is to improve professional development and opportunities for UCSB Chemical Engineering Students and most of the students use Discord for communication. So, I decided to help pass along internship and full-time opportunities using a Discord Bot that got relevant Job Alerts from LinkedIn, put it into MongoDB, and then send these opportunities every weekend so students can apply!

After this project, the Google API finally clicked for me. I also used Cheerio.js for the first time to parse HTML (I used Python's BeautifulSoup previously to parse HTML). It was also an interesting challenge to try to find a way to circumvent LinkedIn's strict policy on no webscraping of job postings.

Take a look!
