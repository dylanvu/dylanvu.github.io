SeenIt

/projects/web-development/seenit/seenit.png

This was a team project for Coders SBâ€™s React workshop. SeenIt is a movie social media web app, built with Node.js as the backend and React as the frontend. I handled the majority of the styling and layout of the web app and created React components to render specific movie information and user-favorited movies.

This was the project that essentially taught me the basics behind React.js
